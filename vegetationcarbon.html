		<h2>The Importance of Vegetation Carbon Sequestration</h2>
                <p>Ecosystems play a crucial role in regulating Earth's climate. One of the most important services they provide is carbon sequestration, the process of capturing and storing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Vegetation, particularly forests, plays a vital role in this process. By absorbing carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, vegetation helps to mitigate climate change and improve air quality.

In Ireland, our diverse landscapes, from lush forests to expansive grasslands, contribute significantly to carbon sequestration. However, human activities such as deforestation and land-use change can impact these ecosystems and reduce their ability to store carbon.

To better understand the carbon sequestration potential of different land cover types, a detailed map has been created. This map highlights areas with high carbon storage capacity, such as mature woodlands, and areas with lower carbon storage, like grasslands and bare ground. By identifying these areas, we can develop strategies to protect and enhance carbon sinks, contributing to a more sustainable future.</p>

	<h2>Understanding the Map: Vegetation Carbon Sequestration</h2>
               <p>The darkest colors represent areas with higher vegetation carbon storage. Lighter colors indicate areas with lower carbon storage potential.</p>
		<h2>Why It's Important:</h2>
		<p>Through photosynthesis, vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and stores it in its biomass. Mature woodlands, with their extensive root systems and dense canopy, are particularly effective at storing carbon. Grasslands and bare ground, while still important, have lower carbon storage capacity.
		Terrestrial ecosystems, especially forests, play a crucial role in mitigating climate change by absorbing and storing carbon dioxide. By protecting and restoring these ecosystems, we can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.</p>

		<h2>How the Map Was Created:</h2>
		<p>This map was created using data sourced from the National Parks & Wildlife Service (NPWS) (2017) <strong>Ecosystem Services, Mapping and Assessment National Pilot</strong>. The NPWS data was processed and analyzed to identify areas with high potential for carbon sequestration, such as woodlands, wetlands, and grasslands.

To focus on the Dublin region, the data was further processed in QGIS, allowing for visualization and analysis at a more localized level.</p>
