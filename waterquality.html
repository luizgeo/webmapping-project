                <h2>The Importance of Water Quality</h2>
                <p>
                    Water, the lifeblood of our planet, is essential for the health and well-being of all living things. It's not just a resource; it's a complex system that supports countless ecosystems and the services they provide. From the lush forests to the bustling cities, water quality plays a crucial role in maintaining the delicate balance of nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Ireland, water quality is a significant concern, particularly in urban areas like Dublin. Urbanization, industrial activities, and agricultural runoff can degrade water bodies, leading to a decline in biodiversity and ecosystem services. Poor water quality can impact aquatic life, reduce recreational opportunities, and pose risks to public health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To better understand and address these challenges, a comprehensive mapping project was undertaken. The map below provides valuable insights into the areas that temporarily store water, a vital ecosystem service that helps regulate water flow and mitigate flood risks. By understanding these areas, we can make informed decisions to protect and restore our water resources.

                <h2>Understanding the Map: Water Filtration Capacity</h2>
                <p>
                    The darkest areas on the map highlight land that's best at filtering pollutants from water, leading to cleaner water. In contrast, lighter areas may be contributing to water pollution.
                </p>

                <h2>Ecosystem service: Water Purification</h2>
                <p>
                    Land cover plays a crucial role in filtering pollutants from water runoff. Natural landscapes like forests and wetlands, with their complex root systems and diverse vegetation, are particularly effective at filtering pollutants, improving water quality in downstream areas.
                </p>

                <h2>Why It's Important</h2>
                <p>
                    The health of our waterways depends on the land around them. Natural landscapes like forests and wetlands help purify water. Urban areas, with their hard surfaces, can hinder water filtration and lead to dirtier waterways.

                <h2>How the Map Was Created</h2>
                <p>
                    This map was generated by using the National Parks & Wildlife Service's Ecosystem Services, Mapping and Assessment National Pilot, which was created by combining various datasets, including habitat information, slope, soil, and geological data. Soil type and geology play a vital role in determining a region's filtration capacity. It's important to note that this map represents the best available information based on current data.

                <h2>Water Quality in Ireland: A Closer Look</h2>
                <p>
                    To better understand the broader context of water quality in Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides a valuable resource: an interactive web map that allows users to explore spatial data related to water quality. This map offers a detailed view of water quality parameters across the country, enabling users to identify areas of concern and potential pollution sources.
